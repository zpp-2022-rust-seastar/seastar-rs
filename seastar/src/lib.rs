/// A macro intended for running asynchronous tests.
/// Tests are spawned in a separate thread.
/// This is done to ensure thread_local cleanup between them
/// (at the time of writing, Seastar doesn't do it itself).
///
/// # Usage
///
/// ```rust
/// #[seastar::test]
/// async fn my_test() {
///     assert!(true);
/// }
/// ```
pub use seastar_macros::test;

/// A macro that runs the `main` function's contents
/// in Seastar's runtime. **Only** `main` is allowed
/// to use this macro - Seastar apps may only use
/// one `AppTemplate` instance at a time.
///
/// # Options
///
/// Currently, passing options is not supported.
/// The app is simply run with default parameters.
///
/// # Usage
///
/// ```rust
/// #[seastar::main]
/// async fn main() {
///     println!("Hello, world!");
/// }
/// ```
